This site was generated with [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), an open source static site generator that turns markdown files into html.

The theme used is [Hugo-Coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/).

The site is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Changes are made locally and then pushed to a github repository main branch, which immediately rebuilds it.
